            <h4>Easy Hand Rolled Sushi/Temaki</h4>
            <p>Temaki is hand rolled sushi and it's a great easy snack to make</p>
            <p>This is a very accessible recipie and a really fun hand food especially for teaching 
            kids about different types of foods</p>
            <p>Don't worry about making it look like the picture, the best thing about this recipie 
            is it's very accessible and fun
            </p>
            
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Nori sheets - you can buy temaki sheets or just cut regular sheets in half</li>
                <li>Cooked Sticky Rice - best prepared as Sushi rice</li>
                <li>Various ingredients chopped lengthways</li>
                <li><em> e.g.</em> Cucumbers, carrots, avocado, salmon, chicken, tofu, or anything else you can think of</li>
                <li>Sauces - Soy sauce, Kewpie mayonnaise, Chimichurri, Peanut sauce, Curry sauce, Harissa, Worcestershire, try anything!</li>
                <li>Garnishes - again, try anything! - pickled ginger is great, I like slivers of fresh garlic, sundried tomatoes, even sliced pickled onions</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare your rice - any sushi rice recipie from allrecipes.com will do. You can also use microwaved rice packets as long as the rice comes out reasonably sticky</li>
                <li>Prepare a platter of ingredients - you don't have to stick to standard sushi ingredients, it's fun to mix and match different textures and flavours</li>
                <li>Grab a sheet of nori in your hand and start with speading rice on the paper - it should be dry and crinkly - don't wet it first, the rice will make it malleable.</li>
                <li>Now layer any other ingredients on and add your sauces and garnishes</li>
                <li>Roll or fold it up</li>
                <br>
                <em>Optional</em>
                <li>If you're just making a quick snack for yourself you can cut the sheets into 4 squares, add some sauces and garnishes to rice, then with a spoon make small rice balls and grab it with the nori. With a little practice this is a very easy technique to do without creating mess</li>
            </ol>
